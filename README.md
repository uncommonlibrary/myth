# Myth

Myth aspires to be like Goodreads and StoryGraph without all the clutter of having to fill up a lengthy questionnaire about each book before you can mark them as read.

**A simple reading web app**

As an avid reader myself, I religiously keep track of the books I read and use apps like Goodreads to store them.

While some readers might find joy in filling up the post-reading questionnaire and leaving lengthy reviews, I find this experience very noisy. There's just too much going on.

**Myth - The Book App**

Myth targets readers who desire a simplified experience of the book tracking app.

There are only three shelves: your TBR, your current library, and your archive of read books.

In addition to tracking your reading progress, Myth desires to provide two more features - writing notes and sharing your library.

In fulfillment of the second coding bootcamp project to build a React application with partial/full CRUD, I have completed one of the features.

## Getting Started

Begin your reading journey by "logging in" to your account.

Search books by title or author and add them to the respective shelves: TBR for to-be-read, library for your current reads, and archive for read books.

See how I planned this game [here](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKrudW3Y=/?share_link_id=385691609527).
